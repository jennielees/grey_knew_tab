I didn't like the preset colour schemes so modified them and while I was there, added HN as a news source. Also removed some of the new tab UI to make it slightly cleaner and added a settings icon instead of the text menu.

All rights and creativity belong to the original author. I'm putting this out there to potentially save others time, and allow myself easy access from other machines :-)
